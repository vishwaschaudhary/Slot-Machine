This is a web scraper project to scrape wallpapers from a website unaplash.com.  
We have followed the following steps in making this project:
- Take a look at the website's html page and find out the classes and source links which contains the images then. So that we can search them when we import their html data using python.
- First we found out the source url of a single image which was too long so we would try to minimize it by removing the extra length then we would only extract out the limited url useful for image generation.
